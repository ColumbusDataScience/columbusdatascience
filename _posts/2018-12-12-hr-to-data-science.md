title: From HR to Data Science
tags: talks
---

With a master's degree in HR, I got my first job as an HR analyst in the states. Three years later, I am now a data scientist who builds products and tells stories with data everyday. People often ask me what it's like to transition from HR to data science. Well, it is like a wizard coming from a Muggle family. I will never forget the life changing moment when I built my first predictive model using R. It was magic!

But I would be lying to say that the magic came easily. As someone who is self-taught, I worked hard but still struggled when I first started out. Looking back on how far I have come, I want to share a few things I wish I knew with those who are in non-technical roles but aspire to be data scientists.

I believe that you do not need to have a degree in computer science or math to become a data scientist. I hope what I have shared can encourage more people who are on the journey of transitioning into data science field.
