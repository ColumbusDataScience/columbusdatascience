Many companies struggle with data science project development and deployment. In these cases, the majority of data scientistsâ€™ time is often spent on data exploration and data preparation. Data processing is time consuming and may even require months to re-code the model in the production system for deployment. In this talk, you will learn how Alliance Data has accelerated data science. By leveraging big data engineering, Alliance Data is able to streamline data acquisition, build out repeatable and scalable data ingestion and curation pipeline, automate feature engineering and use a variety of tools to speed up model development and deployment.
