title: Data Science at Root Insurance
tags: talks
---

Starting a telematics-based car insurance company from scratch comes with a host of interesting data science challenges. The lack of historical data makes it difficult to construct accurate predictive models. On the other hand, dealing with a flood of smartphone sensor data requires us to build large-scale systems that ride the big data wave rather than being submerged by it. In this talk, we will take a whirlwind tour of topics like adverse selection, telematics risk-scoring, pricing and reserving models, and how we think about industry research projects. Time permitting, we will present a method for fitting tree-based models with shape constraints.

## About the Speakers

David Martin has lived in Ohio his entire life. After earning his BS in Pure Mathematics from Youngstown State University, he went on to Kent State University where he received his PhD in Applied Mathematics. His research focused on good, fast, cheap approximations to matrix functions, with applications to linear discrete ill-posed problems, image processing, and complex networks. After graduating, he worked at Progressive Insurance for 4 years, where he built a more predictive telematics risk score, and figured out how to accurately measure risk using noisy smartphone sensors. In 2015, he came to Root as one of the first few employees, and has been leading telematics and data science efforts as the Chief Data Scientist ever since.

Matt Bonakdarpour is the VP of Data Science at Root. He helps lead data science efforts on topics like telematics risk-scoring, pricing, reserving, and marketing. Before Root, Matt was a Quantitative Researcher in the quantitative strategies group at a Chicago hedge fund. He holds a PhD in Statistics from The University of Chicago, and a BS in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.
