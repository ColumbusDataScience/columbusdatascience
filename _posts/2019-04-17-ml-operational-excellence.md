title: Achieving ML Operational Excellence
tags: talks
---

As adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence continues to grow, operational excellence in deployed ML assets will become as important as building the models themselves. The ability not just to develop models, but to version, deploy, and monitor them (and to automate this process) will drive differentiation and competitive advantage in the market. In this talk, we will discuss strategies for building and deploying high quality improvements to these models at scale, and how to engineer a model development lifecycle that supports this goal.
