title: Building and Deploying Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0
tags: talks
---

In this workshop, we will introduce you to TensorFlow 2.0 and to model-building styles for beginners and experts, including sequential, functional, and subclassing APIs. You'll see complete, end-to-end code examples in each style, from "Hello, world" all the way through advanced examples. We will also demonstrate how to deploy your trained models using TensorFlow Serving to support real-time and batch inference.
