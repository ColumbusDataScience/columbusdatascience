title: Model Vs. Reality
subtitle: Responsible model building and validation
tags: talks
---

Data scientists apply technology and expertise to reveal hidden patterns. Or to find patterns that don't really exist. Smart data scientists learn how to avoid 'stupid data mining tricks'. The same skills that help us construct beautiful models that ignore reality can also help us identify false patterns. We'll discuss where things can go off the rails and how to stay on track. Topics include the nature of randomness and the science of cross-validation. Join us for an interactive discussion that can help you see the patterns behind the patterns.
