tags: talks

In a technology-heavy industry, how do you actually present the value of technology – in this case data science – to those that are surrounded by it, but don’t understand it? In this talk, I’ll present some useful tips for communicating the what and why of data science to a non-technical audience using examples from when I’ve had to do it! I’ll then present the AI product that we built for radiologists at Radiology Partners and discuss some challenges we are facing in operationalizing such a solution in clinical practice.
