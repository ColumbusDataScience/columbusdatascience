What happens when you raise the state minimum wage? Did your advertising campaign succeed in raising revenue? Does investing in stem cell research actually lead to more research?

These questions come from vastly different contexts, but are fundamentally questions about causation. That is, what effect will taking a particular action or implementing a policy have? Randomized experiments (e.g. A/B tests) are often described as the gold standard for estimating causal effects, but experiments are not always feasible to run. Economists have worked around this through the use of quasi-experiments, sometimes known as "natural experiments".

In this talk, I introduce quasi-experimental methods (e.g. difference-in-differences and instrumental variables) that have become commonplace in empirical economics and many other social sciences. I will use a variety of examples from business cases as well as my own work in the economics of innovation. By the end of this talk, the audience will walk away with a strong intuition for what these methods can and cannot do, and how they can be applied across multiple contexts.
