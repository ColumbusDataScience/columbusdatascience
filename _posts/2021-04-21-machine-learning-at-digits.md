title: Machine Learning at Digits
tags: talks
---

Machine learning applications are ubiquitous today, but the development of those applications is often ad-hoc and lacks reproducibility or scalability. With machine learning at the core of Digits, we have focused on automating our processes around model training and deployments. In this talk, Jo & Hannes will share their key learnings and insights into the machine learning tools used at Digits. They’ll also discuss the benefits of focusing on ML Engineering besides the actual model development work. You’ll gain an understanding on how to take a machine learning experiment, build machine learning pipelines and deploy it into a production environment.
