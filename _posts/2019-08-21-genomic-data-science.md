This talk will focus on the intersection of data science and genomics research. Have you ever wondered about the research that allows Ancestry or 23andme to tell your traits just looking at your genome? Or how we can use genetic information to advance treatments for complex conditions like diabetes, heart abnormalities, Parkinson disease, and Crohn disease? Well, that's what Ezgi is aiming to tell us about. She will also talk about an R package (gwasurvivr) she co-developed in her lab, and why having data science skills is so crucial for biomedical research in the post-genomic era.
