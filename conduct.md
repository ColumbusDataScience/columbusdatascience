_This is adapted from the both the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://hg.python.org/coc/rev/689163936c9d) and the [PyCon Code of Conduct](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct/tree/2f4d980c8df6f1473d814c0af66f0243b842059f)._

Our community is made up of members with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep the Columbus data science community a positive, successful, and growing community.

We seek to provide a positive, constructive, and informative experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Columbus data science community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
