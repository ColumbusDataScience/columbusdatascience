Welcome to the Columbus Data Science Meetup community! Started in 2018, our goal is to connect the greater Columbus data science and analytics communities through regular meetups, events, and workshops. For a complete listing of all upcoming events, please check out our organization's [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Columbus-Data-Science/) page. If you would like to browse through previous speakers' slide decks and recorded presentations, head over to our [Archive](archive.html?tag=talks).


# How can I present at an upcoming meetup?

If you're interested in presenting at an upcoming meetup, just fill out our [Propose a Talk](https://github.com/ColumbusDataScience/columbusdatascience/issues/new?assignees=wetherc&labels=abstract&template=speaker-proposal.md&title=Abstract+Proposal) form and we'll get in touch! Don't worry if you don't have every little detail ironed out just yet: we just want to get an idea of what you want to talk about, and its level of technical difficulty. We'll work with you in the lead-up to your presentation to help make sure that everything goes off without a hitch.

If you don't have a GitHub account or just don't want to use that form to propose a talk, that's no problem: you can also [drop us a love note](mailto:contact@columbusdatascience.org) via email and we'll get the ball rolling.


# Can I see the slides from an old meetup?

Yes! We publish the slides from all prior meetups to our [Archive](archive.html?tag=talks). Most of our talks will also be recorded and published to YouTube.


# How can I get involved?

There are plenty of ways! Just to name a few:
  - Volunteer to present at an upcoming meetup. We always are in need of new speakes and topics!
  - Tell us about [what topics you're interested in](https://goo.gl/forms/FaHd2Cje1XMf2N0y2). This is the best way for us to keep our meetups relevant and engaging!
  - Contribute to our website. This is all open source and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ColumbusDataScience/columbusdatascience). Notice something's missing? Submit a PR!
  - Help organize an upcoming meetup. Just [shoot us an email](mailto:contact@columbusdatascience.org) if you'd like to help out in this way.
